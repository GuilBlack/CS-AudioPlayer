# CS-AudioPlayer

This is a learning project to understand for .NET Core works.
It's made with 2 CRUD, one the manage playlists and one to manage the different songs of the playlist. The songs have an audio visualiser 
I also used the IdentityUser class to create users.
I used an MVC design pattern for this project as well as repositories to have a loose coupling system.
I also tried to do some unit testing using XUnit and Moq but for the moment I don't understand how to use Moq with DBsets that has relations.
